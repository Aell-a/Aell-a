Hi, I'm Ela or Aella as I'm known on the internet.
I'm a 26 years old and engineer. 
Although I've studied in an unrelated field, for last 6 months I've been working on my path to become a web3 developer because I want to be part of the future. 
That decision was not easy to make but as I get to know more people and amazing projects I believe I made the right choice.
